## Project Overview
**Vanilla-ORF-Detector** is a purely foundational, from-scratch bioinformatics tool written in Python. It parses standard FASTA files, identifies valid Open Reading Frames (ORFs), transcribes the DNA into mRNA, and translates the sequences into both 3-letter and 1-letter amino acid protein structures. 

### The "Vanilla Python" Philosophy (Why not Biopython?)
If you are reviewing this code, you might wonder why I manually hardcoded a 64-codon dictionary or built custom string-slicing loops to map reading frames instead of simply importing `Bio.Seq` from the Biopython library. 

**This is an intentional, pedagogical and self-imposed constraint.** As a 3rd-year biology student in Grenoble, my goal with this personal challenge was to deeply understand and computationally replicate the mechanical logic of the ribosomal machinery and the Central Dogma of molecular biology. Relying on external "black box" libraries would defeat the purpose of the exercise. Every algorithmic choice here (from the step-of-3 indexing to the reverse-complement strand mathematics) was written explicitly to prove a granular understanding of genomic translation.

## Core Features
* **Custom FASTA Parsing:** Seamlessly handles multi-line sequence concatenation and whitespace stripping without external dependencies.
* **Strict ORF Detection:** Scans the forward and reverse strands for the `ATG` start codon, stepping exactly in-frame (modulo 3) until an established stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`) is reached. 
* **Nested ORF Filtering:** Utilizes a heuristic `used_stops` tracking system to prioritize the longest functional reading frame and prevent reporting smaller, redundant ORFs.
* **Bi-Directional Coordinate Mapping:** Accurately maps the 1-based start and end coordinates of reverse-complement ORFs back to the original forward strand.
* **Batch Processing:** Automatically processes all `.fasta` files located in the `/data` directory and exports structured reports to `/results`.

## Architecture
The directory structure intentionally mirrors the biological flow of information:

```text
Projet_Detecteur_ORF/
├── data/                  # Input .fasta files
├── results/               # Output text reports
└── src/
    ├── fasta_to_dna.py    # Sequence extraction
    ├── dna_to_codon.py    # Frame reading & Start/Stop identification
    ├── dna_to_rna.py      # Transcription logic
    ├── dna_to_protein.py  # Translation
    ├── results_export.py  # Report generation
    └── main.py            # The execution pipeline
```

## Usage

1. Place your target `.fasta` files into the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main pipeline from the root directory:

    ```
    python src/main.py
    ```
    
3. Enter your desired minimum ORF size in amino acids (defaults to 50) when prompted.
4. Retrieve your detailed analysis reports in the `results/` folder.
